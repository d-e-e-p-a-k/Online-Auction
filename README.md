# Online-Auction
Online Auction System using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP
Our system has been designed to be highly scalable and capable of supporting large numbers of bidders in an active auction. The online auction system lets you easily browse lots and place bids using a secure server. The objective is to develop a user-friendly auctioning site where any kind of product can be auctioned and provide value-added services to the bidders and the sellers. The products will be authenticated and the site provides a safe environment for online users.
